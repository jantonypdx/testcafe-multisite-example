## TestCafe example tests:

See the defined scripts in `package.json`. To easily run any of these scripts:

1. `npm install` this repo

2. Run `npx ntl`. This will present a (Node Task List)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/ntl] menu of any script to run. Arrow up & down to select any script, then press "Enter".

Example Node Task List menu:
```
⬢  Node Task List

  refactored-single-site
  multi-site-1
  multi-site-2
  multi-site-3
